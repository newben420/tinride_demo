## Overview

TinRide is a free, user-friendly app that simplifies navigation and management of the Tin City Metro bus system. Built with a focus on accessibility in regions with limited internet, it operates offline-first (except for live tracking), making it ideal for users where connectivity can be inconsistent.

### Key Features

- **Offline-First Design**: Plan trips, access timetables, and view maps without internet (live tracking requires connectivity).
- **Live Tracking**: Real-time bus locations with a last-updated timestamp for reliability.
- **Interactive Maps**: Supports Google and Apple Maps with zoom options (journey region, street view), marking user location, buses, and stops.
- **Trip Planning**: Auto-selects routes and buses, with saveable favorite routes.
- **Emergency Assistance**: Report incidents with escalation to authorities or users.
- **Metro Card Management**: Purchase, recharge, and monitor cards (real-time balance feature coming soon).
- **Localization**: Available in English and other popular/native languages spoken in the city, with a user-friendly interface (Light/Dark Mode).
